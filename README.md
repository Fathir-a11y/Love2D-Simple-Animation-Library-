# Love2D-Simple-Animation-Library-
A foundational animation class for LÃ–VE 2D. This module simplifies managing sprite-based animations by automatically parsing your spritesheets into Quads. It uses time-based progression (delta time) for smooth playback and provides core methods like update, draw, play, pause, and stop. Focus on your game logic, not manual frame calculations!
