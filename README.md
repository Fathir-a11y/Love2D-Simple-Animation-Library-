# Love2D-Simple-Animation-Library-
A robust and simple animation class for LÃ–VE 2D. It automatically parses spritesheets into Quads and uses time-based progression for smooth playback. Now features enhanced looping control, allowing for both endless loops (run, idle) and single-pass playback (attack, death). Includes core methods: update, draw, play, pause, and stop.
