Animation Library for LÖVE 2D
=============================

A simple, lightweight animation class for LÖVE 2D. 
Focuses on simplicity and ease of use, so you can spend more time on your game logic and less time on frame calculations.

Features
--------
- Looping and non-looping animations
- Automatic spritesheet slicing (frameWidth × frameHeight)
- Time-based animation using delta time (dt)
- Easy-to-use control methods:
    * update(dt)      -- advance the animation
    * draw(x, y, r, sx, sy) -- render current frame
    * play()          -- start/resume animation
    * pause()         -- pause animation
    * stop()          -- stop and reset to first frame
    * setFrame(n)     -- manually set the frame

Philosophy
----------
- Keep it simple: one library, minimal boilerplate.
- Focus on game logic: let the library handle frame slicing and timing.
- Easy to use: intuitive methods, ready to integrate into any Love2D project.
